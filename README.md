trailsforthepeople
==================

The trailsforthepeople is a web-based application initially funded by [Southwest General Health Center](http://www.swgeneral.com/) and developed by [GreenInfo Network](http://www.greeninfo.org/) (specifically [@gregallensworth](https://github.com/gregallensworth) ) which provides park users with an easy way to find picnic areas and trailheads, discover new healthy outdoor opportunities and find their way in the woods. The design is straightforward and intuitive, providing complete information about trails, hiking, biking and horse riding. Park users can even search for these opportunities based on trail length.
 
The application is a codeignitor application, backed by PostGIS and pgRouting.  At this time, the front and back ends are tightly coupled, although in the future it is expected that the API and front end portion will be less coupled and perhaps independent projects.
